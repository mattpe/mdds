# Media Distribution and Data Streams 5

## Streaming with Icecast server

Building a basic internet radio service. (If you want, you can try using Icecast with a video stream too.)

### Setting up server side

1. On server, install [Icecast](https://icecast.org/) (`sudo apt install icecast2` in Ubuntu)
    - Choose "Yes" to create the basic configuration with setup wizard
    - Check [configuration](https://icecast.org/docs/icecast-2.4.1/config-file.html) by editing the config file `/etc/icecast2/icecast.xml` (remember to restart with `systemctl` if modified)
1. Configure your firewall to accept connections from internet to Icecast
1. To test open in browser <http://YOUR-IP-OR-HOSTNAME:8000> (or whatever port you set in config)
1. Extra: Use SSL/TLS to secure the connection using Apache (this is the last step, make sure that system works without TLS encryption first)

### Client side streamer - Option A: BUTT (easiest)

1. Download & install [butt](http://danielnoethen.de/butt/)
1. Add your Icecast server to _settings_
    - _Main_ tab -> _ADD_ -> set your server details
    - _Audio_ tab -> choose your audio input device
1. Press _play_ button to start butt to stream your mic input from your local computer to Icecast

### Client side streamer - Option B: VLC

1. As a first test, use VLC on your local computer to send a stream to Icecast.
    1. menu: _Media_ -> _Stream..._
    1. select a file, then _stream_ and in the _Destination Setup_ screen, choose _New destination: Icecast_ and click _add_
        - Address: your server ip / hostname
        - Port: 8000 (unless you changed it in config)
        - Mount point: test (or whatever you like but URL firendly: no รครถ, spaces, specials characters, etc...)
        - Login:pass: source:your-password (or something else if you changed the source password in config)  

### Client side streamer - Option C: Your choice (preferred)

- Test/use any other [streaming source software](https://icecast.org/apps/) for streaming to Icecast
- Check possibilities to use production devices in media lab?

### Server side HTML

1. Create an html page to autoplay your radio channel (use html5 [`<audio>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) with `src` attribute pointing to your stream url on Icecast server)
1. Note that serving mixed content, e.g. http audio stream on a html page that is served over https causes problems ([Chrome won't work](https://www.howtogeek.com/443032/what-is-mixed-content-and-why-is-chrome-blocking-it/) but you can still try for example with Firefox)

## Assignment 5

1. Setup Icecast on Azure Ubuntu virtual server
1. Setup a client streamer software on your laptop/desktop computer
1. Stream audio (or video) via Icecast from local computer to other client computers
1. Test playing the stream with another computer (consumer of the stream) e.g. by using VLC as a player software
1. Create simple html page for playing your stream (Radio player)
1. Use Icecast admin panel to monitor connections

Returning: Short report including a written description and screen shots displaying the working system. Check assignment in OMA.  

Grading: max. 4 points.

- Tip for Apache SSL/TLS proxy: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66096779/icecast-behind-apache-proxy-setup-how-to-preserve-the-original-listener-ip>, following example serves unsecure Icecast service on port 8000 via SSL/TLS secured Apache proxy on port 8001:
  - create _/etc/apache2/sites-available/001-icecast.conf_ and check _000-default-le-ssl.conf_ for server specific details:

    ```conf
    <IfModule mod_ssl.c>
    <VirtualHost *:8001>

            ServerAdmin ?????
            ServerName ?????

            ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
            CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

            SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/????????????????????
            SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/????????????????????
            Include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-apache.conf

            RemoteIPHeader X-Forwarded-For
            RemoteIPInternalProxy 127.0.0.0/8

            ProxyPreserveHost On

            ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8000/
            ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8000/

    </VirtualHost>
    </IfModule>        
    ```

  - _/etc/apache2/ports.conf_, add 8001:

    ```conf
    Listen 80
    <IfModule ssl_module>
            Listen 443
            Listen 8001
    </IfModule>
    <IfModule mod_gnutls.c>
            Listen 443
    </IfModule>
    ```

  - _/etc/icecast2/icecast.xml_, add to existing `paths` block:

    ```conf
    <paths>
        <x-forwarded-for>127.0.0.1</x-forwarded-for>
        ...
    </paths>
    ```

  - Enable Apache modules & sites and restart servers:
  
    ```sh
    sudo a2enmod proxy proxy_http remoteip
    sudo a2ensite 001-icecast
    sudo systemctl restart apache2
    sudo systemctl restart icecast2
    ```
